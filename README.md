# GKS-version-2.0-with-bugs
GKS Enterprise: EMAIL VERIFICATION_PASSED, FORGET_PASSWORD_PASSED, CHAT SERVER_SEMI_UP, but workable with separate dedicated url and another sign-in (can omitt chat components that still exist), CRUD is working with ranking and pagination, still problems with database persistants.
